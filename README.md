# Movie_Recommendation_System

Movie Recommendation System
This project implements a movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering. The system is built using Python and the TensorFlow deep learning framework.

The system is divided into the following steps:

Data collection: The system collects data on movies, users, and their ratings. This data can be collected from a variety of sources, such as the MovieLens dataset.

Preprocessing data: Once the data is collected, it needs to be preprocessed to remove noise and improve the accuracy of the model. This includes steps such as removing duplicate ratings, filling in missing values, and normalizing the data.

Building a collaborative filtering model: There are a variety of collaborative filtering models that can be used, such as user-based collaborative filtering and item-based collaborative filtering. The choice of model will depend on the specific data set and the desired accuracy.

Personalizing recommendations: Once the collaborative filtering model is built, it can be used to personalize recommendations for users. This can be done by finding similar users to the current user and recommending movies that those users have rated highly.

Integrating overall features of movie: In addition to collaborative filtering, it is also possible to integrate the overall features of movies, such as genre, popularity, etc., into the recommendation system. This can be done by assigning weights to these features and using them to calculate the overall similarity between movies.

Evaluating the system: Once the recommendation system is built, it is important to evaluate it to ensure that it is providing accurate and personalized recommendations. This can be done by using a variety of evaluation metrics, such as the root mean squared error (RMSE) and the mean absolute error (MAE).
